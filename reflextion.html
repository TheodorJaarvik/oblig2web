        <p>have a maximum of 700 words;•describe the parts that were most difficult to translate from wireframe 
            to actual pages;•discuss the main challenges you had when implementing the page with regards to its 
            responsive nature (dynamic page that scaled with screen size);•explain why you have used "< picture>” 
                or “< img>+srcset attribute”.
            If you have nothing to write, you have made it too easy for yourself! It is simple to do this straight 
            forward and boring, and to end up with pages that looks very different from the wireframe. Your challenge 
            to yourself should be to dare to be createive, and work hard to reproduce it as well as you are able.

            We managed to translate our wirefrimes into code pretty well, but we had some challenges.
            Implementing the page to be responsive to scale and hovers was a challenging aspect but we managed to 
            make the pages work on both mobile and pc.

            In the first version we had some difficulty making the images a specific format in only some cases without 
            strectching them. And making them work in different formats and still be clickable. We also used time making 
            the text appear only when you hover over it without the
            command hiding every div element, but after more research we found a method that worked.

            In the second version we had some difficulty making the menu work in bigger and smaller formats.
