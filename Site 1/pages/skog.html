		<p>Photo: Elias</p>
			<p>This picture was taken in a field near Eiksmarka. It was at the start of Elias and their friends' 
			first ever move. But one of the flatmembers' family was on vacation and could not drive her things 
			to the flat, and this picture is documenting the moving process which consisted of walking and public 
			transport. The people photographed are Mathilde and Ingerid.</p>
