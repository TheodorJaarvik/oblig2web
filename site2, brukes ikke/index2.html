					This was taken 5 mintues before the previous image. Unlike that picture,
					this one was actually taken by Theo Magnor using Ola's phone. It show

					This picture shows Maria at Kadettangen. They had just finally gotten back
					from a year in England, and could finally hang out at our usual hangout
					spots again. This picture also showes that they had not at all lost their
					meme-ridden personality.

					This picture was taken in a field near Eiksmarka. It was at the start of
					Elias and their friends' first ever move. But one of the flatmembers'
					family was on vacation and could not drive her things to the flat, and this
					picture is documenting the moving process which consisted of walking and
					public transport. The people photographed are Mathilde and Ingerid.

					At the very end of summer, the day school started. There was a double
					rainbow. Maybe symbolising that the school year would go okay.
